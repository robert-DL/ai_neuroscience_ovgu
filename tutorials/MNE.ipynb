        "\n",
        "In this tutorial, we explore how we can simulate synthetic EEG data. Personally, I think this is a really exciting topic since it boils down to understanding brain physics. Furthermore, if one is able to simulate meaningful EEG data, which renders cognitive processes, this would mean a large step in this field. However, this is not our aim for the seminar (but could be interesting for a master thesis topic ;) ). \n",
        "\n",
        "Obviously, the simulation of artificial EEG data allows us to provide a large corpus of data for deep neural networks without executing costly experiments. In the context of our projects, this is particularly interesting for the source reconstruction task, but also for the unsupervised feature learning. For the latter one, you could explore if you can learn representations from synthetic data, which could be kind of a proof of concept for reliable data generation. For a more detailed treatment of this topic, you can look into the tutorials and explanations from the MNE page, linked below, as well as in the book from Nunez, linked in the first tutorial.\n",

Heavily related to this topic is the solution to the inverse problem of EEG. By this, we mean the process of inferring the sources within the brain which caused the measured EEG signal. \n",

On the other hand, we need predefined source space activities, so that we can compute the EEG signals from it.

        "The first part deals with the calculation of the so called forward model. The idea is, that you can **calculate a linear transformation**, represented through a matrix, that **maps the source activity** in the brain **to the EEG sensors** and gives us the **desired EEG signal**. Therefore, we need a discrete version of our brain and our head! As you read this, you can already imagine, that this is non-trivial. I do not want to go into the details here as much as the topic is it worth, however, I want to give a short overview.\n",
        "\n",
        "As already mentioned in the first tutorial (did I?), there are **various sources in the brain**, which contribute to the overall EEG signal. It is nearly a hopeless task to represent all of them by their single contribution. A successful approach to overcome this, is the so called **equivalent current dipole (ECD)** model. This model represent the activities of the different sources patch-wise with a single dipole. This makes things easier for us. From this point on, we have to make different assumptions, about how many boundaries are separating the source from the electrodes, the physical properties of those boundaries and so on. This leads one to the question, **how we describe our head and the brain** to model this process. Below, you can see a picture of how such a model looks like. The most common approaches are the Finite-Element-Method (FEM) as well as the **Boundary-Element-Method (BEM)**. The geometry depicted below corresponds to the latter one. \n",

        "As you can see, the model consits of a large number of small, triangular elements. Those elements discretize our continuous space and thus, the governing equations (I spare you the math here). If you discretize the partial differential equations describing the shells, you end up with linear transformations and, luckily, the composition of linear transformations is linear again. In this way, we end up with a simple equation that describes our linear mapping through\n",
